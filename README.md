### üí° My Engineering Philosophy

*   **Business-First:** I believe the best technical solutions are born from a deep understanding of the business problem. I focus on delivering impact, not just code.
*   **Automate Everything:** From infrastructure to data quality testing, I build for efficiency and reliability. If a task is done more than once, it should be automated.
*   **Build for Scale:** I design systems on the cloud with performance and cost-effectiveness in mind, ensuring they can grow with the business.
*   **Clarity and Collaboration:** I excel at communicating complex technical concepts to stakeholders at all levels, ensuring alignment and building trust.
